DALI Social Media Frontend challenge 

Given time constraints on this project, I was not able to debug many different glitches nor add many user functions. The Profile and Friends tab results in a lot of lag due to the many different friend card duplicates. The goal of this is app is to create a digital way to set up events and stay social in real life.
